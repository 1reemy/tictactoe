# tictactoe

This is a Tic Tac Toe game created using Javascript DOM Manipulation, HTML and CSS. 
This exercise makes use of Data Structures and Algorithms and it took me some time to complete! I was very elated when it finally began to work as I expected.
It is open source and can be modified with my permission.
